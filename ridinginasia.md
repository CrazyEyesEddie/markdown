I ride overseas. (Australian and in South India right now.) I've ridden in Thailand. I'd say there are four main things.

1. **Lack of experience**. Motorcycles in any form are not to be taken lightly. Do the damned training, learn to ride at home first. Then when you're in a new country, watch the traffic for a couple of days. Take it cautiously to start out. It doesn't matter if you're 20. You're not invulnerable.


2. **Lack of gear**. Locals ride in t shirts and flip flops. Great. You're not a local, who's ridden here all your life. I ride in full gear. A mesh jacket and summer gloves are not as hot as you think. And they can save your life and at least let you keep your ass meat in a slide. 


3. **Speed**. A lot of the accidents involving farangs in Asia are fast accidents. I remember reading about some bloke missing a corner in Bali and slamming into a wall with no gear going fast. Slow down! We ride fairly big bikes and are always overtaken by 110cc bikes driven by locals. And we arrive at our destination. That is your one job on a bike. 


4. **Booze**. Man, tourists love to drink and ride. I don't even do that at home. Ride somewhere, then drink and get back on the bike the next day. If you have to get around when you're hammered, take a tuk tuk.

If you can't do those four things, take a damned bus. You're endangering locals and other riders.
